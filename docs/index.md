# User for whom the application intended for?

Arsanet is an application that manages the data of a **social network**. It enables to perform some administrative tasks through a friendly
and easy-to-use interface.

It doesn't count with a login system, therefore, it is just intended for `administration`. However, it serves as basis to develop a more
complex and complete project for a real social network app.

The administrator will be the main user of this app. Arsanet provides an interface with **high level of abstraction** from the real
implementation of the project. So this person will not need special capabilities in ICT. The app speaks by its own, and there is no need of
a tutorial to learn how to use it.
